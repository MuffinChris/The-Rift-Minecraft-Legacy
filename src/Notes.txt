Future Planning Segment (LOTS OF GOOD IDEAS FOR INTERESTING MECHANICS):
    Rift Theme:
        - The dungeons are all portal to nother dimension style.
        - idk use pink and purple and incorporate portals.

        - Witcher 3 Style "Great Frost" / "Eternal Winter"
        - Gotta beat it away in future expansions
        - this is the big bad! (perhaps quests o-o?)
    Dynamics and Environment:
        - Weather
         -. Days, seasons, and weather (hypixel style). Useful for economy etc. Also make weather matter (Winter will fuck you up! Winter can also cause Mob faction of winter to spawn and kill u)
         -. Add Dynamic Town Mechanics (resources from nearby resource locations, biome benefits, penalize traveling far [for example, making resource gens need to be close if u want more u need to optimize])
    Farmer Profession:
        - Breed crops to become resistant to weather, provide more resources, etc
    Towns and Professions Interactions:
        - Make it cost lots of resources to build Town machines. Any sort of automation, spawn portals, NPC housing etc needs to follow strict schematic like nether portal and conduit but also gives big buffs
        - NPC Housing could just count as a bed with a door lmao
        - Said buildings that protect and empower town (for example town not protected form start, u need to build a shield gen or smthn) cost resources to maintain
        - Make repairing items cost a lot of mixed ingots and resources so you really need to get more resources which means traveling or optimizing.
        - Resource gens differ based on biome! Exploration! Conquest. New mobs to find and see
        - World Border should be something smaller, idk like 15k by 15k to encourage fights and land management
    Dungeons and Fantasy Worlds:
        - Most Dungeons are placed in entirely new fantasy worlds.
        - Some dungeons are in the main overworld, but they're generic shit for low level grinding. (and potentially some higher level ones spread few and far)
            - Theyre just essentially like oh hey there's a Zombie cave here with evil zombie warlord who might attack a nearby city go fuck with it.
        - These fantasy worlds can have one of many possible stories. Rn here's the basic two
            - You take the rift portal into a human outpost in that world where they fight against hostile forces
            - You take the rift portal into an alien outpost that is allied and fight their enemy with them
            - The entire world is populated with both ally and enemy mobs, with many unique resource nodes you can't find elsewhere.
            - There are enemy cities that you can conquer, these act as dungeons essentially.
                - Some are more linear dungeonlike than others
                - Others are more full on city and you just kill everything that stands in your way, and attempt to reach the center kill the mini boss leader of city or whatever
                - Many cities spread apart, most inward cities are the highest level. This is true for all worlds so you can choose what race to fight but not how far you can go
                - Also challenges to defend allied outposts.
        - Dungeons should also give resource rewards to supplement town resource costs
        - Stunned bosses cant use abilities!
        - Nearby Player size should cause boss to scale. Nearby player size should cause amount of mob spawning
        - SAML Flags on bosses

    Professions:
    Two Professions Primary and Secondary (100 | 50)
    Blacksmith:
        - Do not damage Anvils when using it
        - Can make repair kits
        - Can combine enchantments past big levels (custom define this stuff)
    Enchanter:
        - Can pick any enchantment from Enchantment table (at a large cost of course)
        ( ALTERNATIVELY ENCHANTMENT TABLE IS GONNA BE GEMSTONE INSCRIBING!)
        - Regular players have similar to Vanilla randomized enchantments
    Alchemist:
        - Custom Alchemy Menu that uses many ingredients to craft potions
        - Potions have charges (ie 5/5), and my own custom effects
        - Potions have a max uses (until they must be crafted again). Until then, it requires minor amounts of
            refilling reagents (ie, water + small amnt of initial crafting ingredients) to refill the charges.
            However they break after max uses is gone over.
    Chef:
        - Can cook custom food with bonuses (more hunger regen, health regen, stat buffs minor for long duration etc)
        - Golden apples for custom food!
    Farmer:
        - Can rightclick crops to harvest, seed remains placed.
        - Gets many drops from the farm.
        - Can breed crops together
    Quests and Tutorial:
        - Big Frost Baddie you try and fight in tutorial, you get frozen and preserved for some time, the NPC adventurers pull u out, bring u back to world. (Adventures Log horizon style lmfao)
        - Tutorial Objective and Quest Objectives displayed in top bossbar

        - Report to your Adventurer Squad Commander and try and fight through Icy Dungeon (teaches u classes and combat mechanics)
        - Try and fight the boss frost baddie and lose!

    In general, solo players should use the market or publicly available vendors.

    Leveling:
    - superskills at 30 and 40. 45 is max level gear cap. 50 is prestige.
    - Every 1 level
    - Update levelup msg

    Armor:
        - Each armor type is a set. Classes are bound to one set.
        - Elements give their effects in stats and have identities

DIRECT LINE TODO LIST:

    -47. Cutting the name may leave the chat color symbol without the actual color code thus causing an issue showing only the symbol.

    -46. Add better time command alias

    -45. Thorns makes two damage instances, one environmental heart and one impact

    -44. Resistance potion effect bypasses dmg (fix this and other pot effects).

    -43. Players are not getting ignited lmao

    -42. Hoppers and Hopper Minecarts can still take items out of gravestones. InventoryMoveItemEvent seems to be bugged

    -39. Add fall damage reduction to big boss mobs

    -36. Add seasons

    -34. Reduce length of playername if too big

    -32. Convert Skill Descs to have Ability Power icon! Fix visual display (some skills have electric [pyroclasm] but only display fire)

    -31. Pyroclasm fire not removed on server stop

    -30. Add warmups to Toggles

    -23. Make Discord Bot for auto role (and future stuff)

    -22. Add custom item texture for Basic wand (and add the recipe) as well as Spear?

    -16. Reduce Environmental Damager as level increases (just more durable to environmental sources)

    -15. Make portal system for rift worlds

    -14. Can blaze (and other skills) do damager after log off? (Blaze especially)

    -11. Particles falling from the sky that deal damage (cuth botest)

    -9. Consider implementing different attacks for melee weapons. (ie. Regular Sword LMB is Slash. Crouch LMB is Heavy. Crouch RMB is Spin)

    -8. Regarding Bossbars: Raids have events so you can fake it. Wither and Enderdragon can Packet Remove Bossbar. Also add another bossbar to hide vanilla bossbars, then convert top to Boss hp!

    -7. Friends list, blocking not nice individuals

    -5. Command to set a players class

    -3. Mob HP Bar and Name as hologram

    -1. Add Attributes (heroes style)

    2. Disable Drowned Conversion (have own ocean mobs). Make sure to update DmgThreshold and EDefense when a mob transforms.

    4. Add elemental damage from non player sources (mobs)

    5. Setting to hide dmg holograms

    7. Make guardan lasers and spikes do damage

    8. Make legacy projectiles like fireballs hold a PersistentDataContainer instead of customname (will need to hold Elemental Dmg). Same with Enderdragon damage

    10. Pyroclasm targets allies and in general non pvp targets. Separate targetting func into Target Ally, Target Enemy, Target All.

    12. Zombie Warriors can have Enchanted items and be Baby Mobs (fix dat stuff man)

    13. Make experience bottles give class exp

    14. Make wither always lvl 50

    16. Wither Explosions are crazy Strong.

    17. All biomes capped 1-20 (some a bit higher, but never extremes) Dungeons forced to level

    19. Balance totems of undying (make them good, perhaps have durability or charges!)

    20. Design all custom mobs, step away from formulas. Make sure to use Name PData tag incase mob has dif name than type.

    21. Disallow Shield usage for non shield classes

    22. Iron golem healing is absolute dogshit

    0. ITEM STUFF / IDEAS:
    - make classes use specific item type.
    - TIERS: Mythical, Legendary, Epic, Rare, Uncommon, Common
    - Mythical has unique shit, less randomization, and specific items. Rest are fully randomized.
    - Randomize stats to each weapon that a class must wear (for balancing and better stat allocation)
    - Armor is the more general random portion? (cause u can wear any armor. Perhaps balance based on weight, lower weight generally more magical stats)

    (stuff to do / fix)
    - RANDOMIZE FISHING LOOT AND CHEST LOOT (NATHANWOLF MADE POST ON SPIGOT ABOUT BLOCKPOPULATOR AND TILE ENTITIES)
    - Protection can give bonus armor points? Perhaps percentage armor increase.
    - Test if curse of binding (and even vanishing) breaks shit
    - Put enchantments in specific lore section (hide enchs with itemflag, then place in lore)
    - To make enchantments vanilla irrelevant need to check Ench Table Ench, and Anvil Ench
    - Note to self: Combining Enchantments seems fine. Takes the lore of the first item. So just need to make sure lore will contain the new enchantment. USE NBT!
    - Need to make Villager traded items custom! (perhaps make villagers trade high end random items)
    - Elytra durability (ALL DURABILITY) needs to have affects other than removal of stats (elytra is an active)
    Links for Info:
        https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Item_repair
        https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting
        https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Item_durability

    - Add all durability items to custom durability (Fishing Rods n Stuff)
    - Make Custom Anvil and Enchantment Table
    - In general custom enchantments. Allow unbreaking up to 10, etc, essentially remove Vanilla enchants, everything custom. That means removing Proj Prot etc.
    - Need to make drops and loot not have vanilla enchantments. If the enchantment is not supported (like proj prot), remove it!
    - Make sure to change existing ench changes (ie. mending)


 RIFT THEME IDEAS:
    Players can open a personal rift using a Rift Key or Rift Gem or Rift Stone
    The personal rift is an end world with no blocks, cancel all mob spawning, perhaps do custom biome?
    The personal rift needs to disable things like Wither and stuff.
    Personal rift = hide all players including self, and check if login world is Personal Rift area.
    Surrounded with black wool or concrete and barriers, grant them a 5x5 chunk of space to work in.

    Towns:
        - Anchors - "Anchor" points that allow people to teleport to using rift tech
        - Rift generator - Open a rift and enter it, can teleport to an anchor or random location
        - Terrain control and claiming needs to be done based off of a source block, ie. Nexus
        - Regenerator Core - Heal all damage done to blocks through explosions and mobs


    Rifts can open and spawn bosses
    Rifts can open for other things too...
    Blood Moon - Rifts spawn with red mobs, drops red essence or something of the sort.

* Class ideas:
* Build out of components for certain classes, like Warframe. Unlock em!
* Alternate Resource Systems, like Rage, Shadow, etc, thematic!
