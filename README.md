# The Rift
Codebase for The Rift, a Minecraft Multiplayer Experience

Server IP: therift.net
Version: 1.15.1 at time of writing, assume latest compatibility

Description: This is a passion project of mine where I can apply my interest in programming and game design to the existing engine that is Minecraft.

# The Server
The intended direction of the server (currently in development) is an RPG Survival where players can level classes and combat each other or other mobs and bosses. Hoping to develop a cool towns system where players can create a dynamic territory that interacts amongst itself and other territories.
